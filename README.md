N-Back
=============

An app to train working memory. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back.

There are many different implementation of this exercise available. 
I started this project to try several ideas of my own.
First idea - noisy shapes - this idea is based on the premise
that brain focuses far more on noisy/blurry images thus one
session should have greater impact on your brain activity.
You should learn faster.

Second idea is based on the positive/negative response from 
playing - assuming that the more spectacular evaluation response
is given the better should be the overall performance. 
None of this ideas are scientifically justifiable - 
basically just experiments - final goal of this application 
should be statistical analysis of gathered data.

My tips on playing -  no rehearsing, picture previous items in
your head - it should be as effortless as possible, no strategies
for different levels. My reason is following - you are trying to
improve your efficiency in real life - you never now which 'n' 
you are going to need and when you are going to need it, your
brain should do this exercise ideally all the time in 
the background so you can access data from relatively short past.
